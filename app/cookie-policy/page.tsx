              <p>
                This Cookie Policy explains how Nofonex Online Services ("Nofonex", "we", "us", or "our") uses cookies
                and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at nofonex.com ("Website"). It
                explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of
                them.
              </p>
              <p>
                In some cases, we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information
                if we combine it with other information.

              <h2>2. What Are Cookies?</h2>
              <p>
                Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
                Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
                efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Nofonex) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set
                by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable
                third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising,
                interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your
                computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

              <h2>3. Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
              <p>
                We use first and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical
                reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly
                necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to
                enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for
                advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.
              </p>
              <p>The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our Website include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services
                  available through our Website and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because
                  these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Website, you cannot refuse them without impacting
                  how our Website functions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Performance and Functionality Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to enhance the
                  performance and functionality of our Website but are non-essential to their use. However, without
                  these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Analytics and Customization Cookies:</strong> These cookies collect information that is used
                  either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Website is being used or how effective our
                  marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Website for you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Advertising Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to make advertising messages more
                  relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing,
                  ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements
                  that are based on your interests.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Social Media Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content
                  that you find interesting on our Website through third-party social networking and other websites.
                  These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes.

              <h2>4. How Can You Control Cookies?</h2>
              <p>
                You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by
                setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select
                which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are
                strictly necessary to provide you with services.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our website. If you choose to
                reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our
                website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse
                cookies.
