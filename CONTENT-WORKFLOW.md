## Content Quality Standards

1. **Authenticity**: Every article should include YOUR perspective as a Suriname-based language professional. AI helps draft, but your experience makes it unique.

2. **Value-first**: Each article should teach the reader something actionable. No fluff.

3. **Bilingual advantage**: Use your English-Dutch expertise. Include Dutch terms, phrases, or translations where relevant. This is your competitive edge.

4. **Faith integration**: For faith-based content, be genuine. Share what matters to you. This resonates more than generic devotional content.

5. **Service connection**: Naturally connect content to Nofonex services without being pushy. Example: "This is exactly the kind of cultural nuance we handle in our transcreation services."

## Growth Targets

| Month | Articles Published | Target Monthly Pageviews |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | 12 | 500 |
| 2 | 12 | 1,500 |
| 3 | 12 | 4,000 |
| 6 | 60+ total | 15,000 |
| 12 | 130+ total | 50,000 |

These are conservative estimates. Consistent, quality bilingual content in the English-Dutch niche has low competition and strong potential.
